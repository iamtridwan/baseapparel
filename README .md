## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

-I learnt how to use the "srcset" attribute of "img element" in html5 to display pictures
for varying screen sizes.

```<img src="", alt="", srcset='specify the various with for the type of image to display'> ```

-I gained better understanding of using grid and flexbox.




 


### Continued development

the webpage needs some interactivity which can be done using javascript. I am learning that skill which when well grapsed will be implemented.



### Useful resources

- (https://www.tutorialpoint.com) - This helped me on how to use the srcset on images. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
